"Loads an asdf system based on the relative path of the current working directory (root of project).
This function is primarily aimed at game dev.
You can use this to load your project specific local systems in a traditional Java/Lua/Python-like manor.
The folder which encapsulates your system must match the name of your system.
The .asd file which identifies your system much match the name of your system.
Arg: relative-path is a list of strings. Pretend each space is walking into a new folder.
Example: (super-load \"game-things/my-cool-system\")
Now system :my-cool-system has been loaded, packages contained inside of it are freely available."
